Film is split into 5 parts:
 * Part 1 "Balance"
 * Part 2 "Changes"
 * Part 3 "The nation"
 * Part 4 "The value of cattle"
 * Part 5 "News from home"


Human life is bound to those forces which sustain it. We have a duty as actors of our planet to in turn sustain the machine that bears up our own particular ways of life. "To Live With Herds" (MacDougall 1968) is a cinematic survey of the broken machine that is the pastoral way of life in northeast Uganda. David MacDougall logically partitions the film into 5 to simply and tragically illustrate the imbalance struck by the new ideals of a post-colonial Uganda and the traditional tribal culture of the pastoral Jie people; "Balance", "Changes", "The nation", "The value of cattle", "News from home". This theme of conflict between "Western" and tribal ideals is pervasive in Modern history as a necessary symptom of colonialism and represents a shared, broken model of the support structure required to sustain human life and culture.

We begin our experience with a view of the balance intended by the Jie pastoral way of life. We are first situated behind a mountain, Toror, and surrounded by neighbouring tribes existing beyond an unseeable distance through the recollection of a single native who gestures about the horizon. Then we are shown the daily chores of herd migrations and cultivation of food, told of sacrificial rites of passage, and the simple life desires of a teenager: find a girl to marry. Our first part is concluded with a quiet, lounging game of Mancala. We are then told of the elders' memories: a more peaceful time under British rule, the emerging of conflict following independence. We see the nation's regulated food distribution, and the neglected, starving populations. We are told of the expectation for children to attend school, herders to pay taxes, and hence the necessity for money. We are brought to a cattle auction that puts a price on a hungry herder's cows, and shown the reliance of the Jie women on "snuff". This tragic spiral is punctuated with the travel of one Jie herder to the others in the mountains who ask him for news from home since their departure. He answers them: "there is no news, just hunger at home".
