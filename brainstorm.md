tribe vs colony

Film is split into 5 parts:
 * Part 1 "Balance"
 * Part 2 "Changes"
 * Part 3 "The nation"
 * Part 4 "The value of cattle"
 * Part 5 "News from home"

Documents a landscape of newly independent Uganda. 

Space:
 * Uganda as a nation has borders

Place:
 * Landscape drawn by Jie pastoralist draws out a space which is made a place by an unequivocal tie to the land - "This is our mountain, it protects us"
 * This sense of place is invaded by new needs imposed by the government's tendency to regulate, and aspire toward a British societal structure: schooling, taxes, trade. 
 * "as unique and complex ensemble -- rooted in the past and growing into a future -- and as symbol, place calls for humanistic understanding." Yi-Fu Tuan Space, Place 1979 p.388
 * "space is formless and profane except for the sites that 'stand out' because spirits are believed to dwell in them. These are the sacred places."

Culture:
 * cultural change, catalyzed by a marked difference in ideals, is not inherently bad, but attitudes of elitism, or belief in a superior set of ideals or standards inhibits balanced resolution, and forbears a resolved sense of identity. 

Overall argument:
Conflict of ideals represents broken understanding of support structure required to sustain a way of life

Outline:
 * Intro
 * Film Synopsis
 * Place for the Jie people
 * Space as Place devoid of meaning in a given cultural frame of reference (Uganda borders meaningless to Jie pastoralists)
 * Culture 

Human life is bound to those forces which sustain it. We have a duty as actors of our planet to in turn sustain the machine that bears up our own particular ways of life. "To Live With Herds" (MacDougall 1968) is a cinematic survey of the broken machine that is the pastoral way of life in northeast Uganda. David MacDougall logically partitions the film into 5 to simply and tragically illustrate the imbalance struck by the new ideals of a post-colonial Uganda and the traditional tribal culture of the pastoral Jie people; "Balance", "Changes", "The nation", "The value of cattle", "News from home". This theme of conflict between "Western" and tribal ideals is pervasive in Modern history as a necessary symptom of colonialism and represents a shared, broken model of the support structure required to sustain human life and culture.

We begin our experience with a view of the balance intended by the Jie pastoral way of life. We are first situated behind a mountain, Toror, and surrounded by neighbouring tribes existing beyond an unseeable distance through the recollection of a single native who gestures about the horizon. Then we are shown the daily chores of herd migrations and cultivation of food, told of sacrificial rites of passage, and the simple life desires of a teenager: find a girl to marry. Our first part is concluded with a quiet, lounging game of Mancala. We are then told of the elders' memories: a more peaceful time under British rule, the emerging of conflict following independence. We see the nation's regulated food distribution, and the neglected, starving populations. We are told of the expectation for children to attend school, herders to pay taxes, and hence the necessity for money. We are brought to a cattle auction that puts a price on a hungry herder's cows, and shown the reliance of the Jie women on "snuff". This tragic spiral is punctuated with the travel of one Jie herder to the others in the mountains who ask him for news from home since their departure. He answers them: "there is no news, just hunger at home".

This tragic arc that David MacDougall deliberately draws is a testament to the film maker's power of persuasion. Indeed, very few words are needed to effectively indicate the key points of the woeful theme; we can fully realize the story by appealing to the compelling and concise lexicon of place, space, and culture. Yi-Fu Tuan distinguishes the first two terms in a strikingly simple interlude to his extensive treatise on Place and Space:

>> space is formless and profane except for the sites that 'stand out' because spirits are believed to dwell in them. These are the sacred places. They command awe. ... places, like human beings, acquire unique signatures in the course of time. ... Loosely speaking, the personality of place is a composite of natural endowment (the physique of the land) and the modifications wrought by successive generations of human beings.

This definition on the one hand invokes a personal sense of awe and attachment to place in our own lives, while on the other hand casts space as its antonym: place devoid of meaning. It is clear that this discrepency is a highly subjective one; that is, a space is only a place to some class of people that shares a similar sense understanding and experience. Furthermore, as this sense directs our individual ways of life, we can consider such classes of individuals with shared understandings to be cultures.

Certainly, the Jie culture has a profound sense of place about and around their mountain, Toror.
